      <h1>8 Self-Defense Moves Every Woman Needs to Know</h1>
      <p>
        Walking home alone and feeling uneasy? Getting a weird vibe from a stranger on the bus? Many of us have been there.
        Here are eight self-defense moves to help you feel empowered and protected in any situation.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Focus on the Vulnerable Areas</h2>
      <p>
        Focus on your attacker's vulnerable areas: eyes, nose, throat, and groin. Avoid the chest and knees.
        Use all of your force and aggression, and be loud to create attention.
      </p>

      <div className="moves-section">
        <h3>1. Hammer Strike</h3>
        <p>Use your car keys to perform a hammer strike if you feel unsafe.</p>
        <img src='/images/sd/selfdefense1.gif' alt = 'hammer strike' />
        <p>Another way to use your keys is to click them onto a lanyard to swing at your attacker.</p>
        <img src='/images/sd/selfdefense2.gif' alt = 'hammer strike' />
        <h4>To Perform</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Hold your key ring in a tight fist, with keys extending from the side of your hand.</li>
          <li>Thrust downward toward your target.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>2. Groin Kick</h3>
        <p>A powerful kick to the groin can disable an attacker.</p>
        <img src='/images/sd/selfdefense3.gif' alt = 'groin kick' />
        <h4>To Perform</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Stabilize yourself as best you can.</li>
          <li>Lift your dominant leg and kick forcefully to the attacker’s groin area.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Alternative:</strong> If your attacker is too close, thrust your knee toward the groin. Make sure you’re stabilized and not at risk of falling over.</p>

        <h3>3. Heel Palm Strike</h3>
        <p>This move targets the nose or throat.</p>
        <img src='/images/sd/selfdefense4.gif' alt = 'heel palm strike' />
        <h4>To Perform</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>With your dominant hand, flex your wrist and aim for the nose or under the chin.</li>
          <li>Recoil your strike quickly to stagger the attacker.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Alternative:</strong> An open palm to the ears can be very disorienting.</p>

        <h3>4. Elbow Strike</h3>
        <p>If the attacker is close, use your elbows.</p>
        <img src='/images/sd/selfdefense5.gif' alt = 'elbow strike' />
        <h4>To Perform</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Stabilize yourself and bend your arm at the elbow.</li>
          <li>Strike with your elbow to the attacker’s neck, jawline, chin, or temple.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>5. Alternative Elbow strike</h3>
        <p>Depending on how you’re standing when you’re initially attacked, you may be in a better position for variations on the elbow strike.</p>
        <img src='/images/sd/selfdefense6.gif' alt = 'alternative elbow strike' />
        <h4>To Perform from the front</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Lift your elbow to shoulder height.</li>
          <li>Pivot on same-side foot and allow your hips to rotate, creating more momentum into the front part of your elbow when you strike.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To Perform from the back</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Make sure you see the target.</li>
          <li>Bring your elbow up and pivot your opposite foot, rotating your hips and turning into the target, making contact with the back part of your elbow.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>6. Escape from a ‘bear hug attack’</h3>
        <p>For cases where the attacker is coming from behind, you’ll want to use this move.
             Focus on getting low and creating space to free yourself.</p>
        <img src='/images/sd/selfdefense7.gif' alt = 'Escape from a ‘bear hug attack’' />
        <h4>To Perform</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Bend forward from the waist. This shifts your weight forward, making it more difficult for your attacker to pick you up. 
              It also gives you a better angle to throw elbows from side to side to the attacker’s face.</li>
          <li>Turn into the attacker with one of your elbows and continue counterattacking.</li>
          <li>This should give you space to turn fully, using another move to injure the face or strike the groin. 
              With the space these moves have created, you may be able to escape and run away.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>7. Escape with hands trapped</h3>
        <p>If your attacker comes from behind and traps your arms 
            (this is similar to a bear hug, but you won’t be able to move as freely), here’s what to do:</p>
        <img src='/images/sd/selfdefense8.gif' alt = 'Escape with hands trapped' />
        <h4>To Perform</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>First reaction should be to stop your attacker’s arms from going higher into a headlock. Shift your hips to one side. 
              This gives an opening for strikes to the groin with open-handed slaps.</li>
          <li>Bring your hand back up to your arms and raise your opposite elbow to turn into the wrap. 
              Keep your arms tight to your chest as you’re turning in.</li>
              <li>Stay aggressive with your knees and other counterattacks until you can disengage.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>8. Escape from side headlock</h3>
        <p>When the attacker locks their arm around your head from the side, your first instinct should be to avoid getting choked</p>
        <img src='/images/sd/selfdefense9.gif' alt = 'Escape from side headlock' />
        <h4>To Perform</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Turn into the attacker’s side as much as possible to avoid being choked.</li>
          <li>With your hand that’s furthest away, strike the groin with open-handed slaps until 
              you have enough mobility to turn your head all the way out to disengage.</li>
        </ol>
